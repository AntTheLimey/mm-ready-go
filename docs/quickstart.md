# Quickstart Guide

Get mm-ready running against your database in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Install

### Option A: go install

```bash
go install github.com/AntTheLimey/mm-ready@latest
```

### Option B: Build from source

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd MM_Ready_Go
make build
```

The binary is at `./bin/mm-ready`.

### Option C: Download a pre-built binary

Download from the releases page for your platform:
- `mm-ready-linux-amd64`
- `mm-ready-linux-arm64`
- `mm-ready-darwin-amd64`
- `mm-ready-darwin-arm64`
- `mm-ready-windows-amd64.exe`

Verify the installation:

```bash
mm-ready --help
```

## 2. Run Your First Scan

The most common usage is a pre-Spock readiness scan against a PostgreSQL
database that does not yet have Spock installed.

**Defaults:** If you don't specify `--format`, `--output`, or a subcommand:

- The subcommand defaults to **scan**
- The format defaults to **HTML**
- The report is saved to the **`reports/`** subdirectory in your current
  working directory, named **`<dbname>_<timestamp>.html`**
  (e.g. `reports/your_database_20260127_131504.html`)
- Timestamps in the filename mean you can re-run without overwriting
  previous results

So the simplest invocation is:

```bash
mm-ready \
  --host your-db-host \
  --port 5432 \
  --dbname your_database \
  --user your_user \
  --password your_password
```

Or use a connection URI:

```bash
mm-ready --dsn "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"
```

You can override any of the defaults explicitly:

```bash
mm-ready scan \
  --host your-db-host \
  --dbname your_database \
  --user your_user \
  --password your_password \
  --format json \
  --output /path/to/report.json
```

## 3. Read the Report

Open the HTML report in a browser. You'll see:

- **Summary table** — total checks run, passed, and counts by severity
- **Readiness verdict** — READY, CONDITIONALLY READY, or NOT READY
- **Findings** — grouped by severity (CRITICAL first), then by category

Each finding includes:
- What was found
- Why it matters for Spock multi-master replication
- How to fix it

## 4. Understanding Severity

| Level | Action Required |
|-------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Must fix before installing Spock. These will cause data loss or replication failure. |
| **WARNING** | Should fix or review. May cause issues in production multi-master operation. |
| **CONSIDER** | Should be investigated. May need action depending on your specific use case. |
| **INFO** | Awareness items. No action required, but good to know. |

## 5. Common Critical Findings

### wal_level is not 'logical'

Spock requires logical decoding. Fix with:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';
-- Restart PostgreSQL
```

### track_commit_timestamp is off

Required for Spock's conflict resolution:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET track_commit_timestamp = on;
-- Restart PostgreSQL
```

### Tables with UPDATE/DELETE activity but no primary key

This is the most dangerous finding. Spock places tables without primary keys
into the `default_insert_only` replication set, where **UPDATE and DELETE
operations are silently dropped**. If your table receives updates/deletes,
those changes will be lost on other nodes.

Fix: add a primary key to the table.

## 6. Output Formats

```bash
# HTML (default — best for viewing in a browser)
mm-ready scan ...

# JSON (best for programmatic consumption)
mm-ready scan ... --format json

# Markdown (best for pasting into tickets/docs)
mm-ready scan ... --format markdown
```

## 7. Filter by Category

Run only specific check categories:

```bash
mm-ready scan ... --categories schema,replication
```

Available categories: `schema`, `replication`, `config`, `extensions`,
`sql_patterns`, `functions`, `sequences`.

See [Checks Reference](checks-reference.md) for full details on every check.

## 8. Audit Mode (Post-Spock)

If Spock is already installed, use audit mode to check for operational issues:

```bash
mm-ready audit \
  --host your-db-host --dbname your_database \
  --user your_user --password your_password
```

Audit mode runs checks specific to Spock installations:
- Replication set membership (are all tables being replicated?)
- Subscription health (any disabled or stalled subscriptions?)
- Conflict log analysis (how many conflicts, on which tables?)
- Exception log analysis (any apply errors causing data divergence?)
- Spock GUC settings (conflict resolution strategy, logging)
- shared_preload_libraries (is Spock loaded?)

## 9. Monitor Mode

Observe database activity over a time window. This snapshots
`pg_stat_statements` at the start and end of the window to identify SQL
patterns (DDL, TRUNCATE, advisory locks, etc.) that emerged during the
observation period.

```bash
# Observe for 5 minutes then generate a report
mm-ready monitor \
  --host your-db-host --dbname your_database \
  --user your_user --password your_password \
  --duration 300
```

The `--duration` flag sets the observation window in seconds (default: 3600 /
1 hour). Requires `pg_stat_statements` to be installed — if it's not
available, the observation phase is skipped gracefully.

## 10. List All Checks

```bash
mm-ready list-checks              # All checks (scan + audit)
mm-ready list-checks --mode scan  # Pre-Spock checks only
mm-ready list-checks --mode audit # Post-Spock checks only
```

## 11. Recommended Pre-Spock Workflow

1. **Run a scan** against your production database (read-only, safe to run)
2. **Fix all CRITICAL findings** — these will prevent Spock from working
3. **Review all WARNING findings** — fix or document accepted risks
4. **Install pg_stat_statements** if not already present — enables SQL pattern
   analysis for richer findings
5. **Re-run the scan** to confirm all critical issues resolved
6. **Proceed with Spock installation**
7. **Run audit mode** after Spock is installed to verify health

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

Ensure the database host is reachable, the port is correct, and `pg_hba.conf`
allows your client IP. If connecting to a Docker container, check that
`listen_addresses` is set to `'*'` (not just `localhost`).

### pg_stat_statements unavailable

Some checks require `pg_stat_statements`. To enable it:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';
-- Restart PostgreSQL
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

Checks that need it will gracefully degrade and report what they couldn't
analyse.

### Permission denied on pg_hba_file_rules

The `hba_config` check reads `pg_hba_file_rules`, which requires superuser
or `pg_read_all_settings` privileges. Grant the role or accept that this
particular check will report an error.
